Could not get either version (spaceDD.py or SpaceDD flat.py) to create a "new galaxy" last time I compiled it. Not sure what broke. 
The part that does work is the "Random Board", it should pull every list and present them for one click return from the random table. << This alone could be a tool. Exists in world, but not great.
This version was before I modified to be able to go "infinitely" deep with stacked Traits.
