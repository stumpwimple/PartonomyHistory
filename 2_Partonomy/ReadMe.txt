This one is a lot closer to my final vision.
But unbeknownst to me at the time, also completely unusable for online connectivity portion I had planned.
Run "partonomy.py" 
Quick start!
Loading the aggregate "test_save - Sample Universe.dat" or "Character Generator.dat", then hit generate.

In the left view pane, you should now see a build aggregate with filled in data. 
Navigate into objects with expand button at right of line, or up with the "To Parent" Button in top left.
